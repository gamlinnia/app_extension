Does Zend_Pdf already support automatic wrapping of text?
For example I want to create a textblock and fill it with text. This is a very important feature and unless Zend Pdf does not have it I am not able to switch from FPDF.
Also I think a Framework that says it has PDF support should be able to offer their developers this kind of feature.
Or am I missing something here?","product short <b>description</b> here...","","Pan: 350 <b>degree</b>
